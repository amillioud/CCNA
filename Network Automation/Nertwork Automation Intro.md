# Network Automation Introductin 

## What is network automation?
Automating repetitive network tasks using scripts or tools (e.g., Python, Ansible, Netmiko).

Traditionally, engineers manage devices one at a time by connecting to their CLI via SSH or Telnet. This model has some downsides when configuring large networks:

- Typos and other mistakes are common
- Time consuming and inefficient
- Difficult to standardize configurations

Network automation provides many benefits:

- Human error, such as typos, is reduced
- Networks become more scalable; allowing quicker deployments and network-wide troubleshooting
- *network-wide* policy compliance can be assured
- Efficiency reduces *operating expenses*

There are varios tools and methods than can be used to automate tasks in the network: SDN (Software defined networking), Ansible, Puppet, Python scripts, etc.
